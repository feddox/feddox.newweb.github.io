	<p><h1><strong>SWEET & SOUR CHICKEN</strong></h1></p>
	<p><h2><strong>INGERIDIENTS:</strong></h2></p>
	<ol>
		<li>2-3 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, (about 400g/14oz total weight)</li>
		<li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
		<li>2 tsp sesame oil groundnut or sunflower oil, for deep frying, plus extra for stir-frying tempura batter (see below)</li>
		<li>1 small red pepper, cored, deseeded and roughly chopped</li>
		<li>1 medium carrot, sliced thinly on the diagonal</li>
		<li>2 fat garlic cloves, chopped</li>
		<li>2 tsp finely chopped fresh root ginger</li>
	</ol>
	<p><h4><strong>For the sauce</strong></h4></p>
	<ol>
		<li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
		<li>3 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
		<li>3 tbsp sherry</li>
		<li>1 tbsp light soft brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 tsp cornflour</li>
	</ol>
	<p><h2><strong>METHODE</strong></h2></p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Cut the chicken into small chunks and mix with the soy sauce and sesame oil. In a jug or bowl, mix together the sauce ingredients with 100ml cold water. Line a large plate with kitchen paper.</p></li>
		<li><p>Heat the groundnut oil in a deep-fat fryer to about 180C. Then dip a few chunks of chicken at a time into the batter, then place in the hot oil using tongs or a slotted spoon, but don’t crowd the pan. Fry until crisp and golden – about 2 mins. You may need to do this in batches, so reheat the oil each time. As the chunks cook, lift out with tongs/spoon to the paper-lined plate to drain.</p></li>
		<li><p>Heat a wok to hot, add about 3 tbsp oil and stir-fry the vegetables with the garlic and ginger for about 3 mins. Give the sauce a quick final stir and pour into the wok, mixing as it cooks to a light glossy sauce. Bubble for 1 min, then spoon over the chicken and serve.</p></li>
